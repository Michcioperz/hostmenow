this is a very basic script that launches lighttpd in the current dir

I've used it for the last few years because `python -m http.server` just doesn't cut

requires lighttpd in PATH, as well as `netifaces` and `qrcode` Python libs

(I'll try to rewrite this stuff in something else like Go or Rust soon)
